# Writing a kernel in Rust

This repo contains my code following the tutorial for writing a simple OS in Rust found [here](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

## Setup
Install `qemu-system-x86_64` and `rustup`.

From `rustup` you should have `cargo`, so you can run `cargo install bootimage`.

## Running

`cargo run` automatically builds and opens qemu.
